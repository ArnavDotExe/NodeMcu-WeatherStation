NODEMCU Weather Station using Blynk 
The connection will be made between the NODEMCU-ESP8266-12E module, DHT-11 Sensor and I2C OLED Display on a breadboard
Blynk will be used to see the data in real-time on the web or mobile phone as long as the weather Station has a stable Wi-Fi connection
The station will display real-time data on the I2C display
Install all the libraries mentioned in the code to get it working :)
